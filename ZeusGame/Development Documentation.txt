I. GETTING SET UP

Zeus Game is a 3D action-adventure game made in Unity under Dr. Marsh at the University of North Dakota. It has been in development since around 2013 across multiple
different development teams. This documentation was created to assist future teams in getting the project set up and orienting themselves to how the game works.

Before you access the game, you should have both the latest versions of Unity and Blender installed and verified to be working. The last versions of each that the project was built with
are as follows. Please update the version numbers below as you upgrade the project:
	Unity:		2019.3.10f1
	Blender:	2.81a

In terms of version control, GitHub is a good free option. The project will be fairly large with all its dependencies (over 13GB), so version control options like BitBucket 
with size restrictions WILL NOT work!

To access the project's dependencies from the Unity Asset Store, you must be logged in to Angie Reinhart's Unity account. Contact Angie or Dr. Marsh for more information.

II. PROJECT DEPENDENCIES & REQUIREMENTS

The project requires that a number of dependencies be installed on the developer's computer in order to the game to function correctly. 
First, there are several assets that must be grabbed from the Unity Asset Store. These should all be able to to be accessed from Angie's Unity account.

Additionally, make sure you have access to the "Parker Materials" folder - it contains modified materials from the above packs that are necessary for the game's objects to render correctly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
III. UPGRADING PROJECT DEPENDENCIES

The project should be upgraded to the newest version of Unity at the time to ensure continued support and stability.
Blender should also be upgraded, as changes in Blender can affect how models are saved, which can cause them to not be loaded correctly in Unity.

Each of the above asset store dependencies should have specific documentation to assist in upgrading them if needed.
